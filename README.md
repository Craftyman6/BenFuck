## What's in the repo?
BenFuck functions identical to the programming language BrainFuck. This repository contains a program that takes .ben (BenFuck) files, creates a .bf (BrainFuck) file from it, and uses a C interpretter (courtesy of Krzysztof Gabis) to run the created BrainFuck file. In addition to being able to convert .ben files into .bf files, included is a seperate program that can convert .bf files into .ben files.
